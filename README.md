# CYB333 Midterm Project â€“ Port Scanner & Socket Communication

This repository contains my completed midterm project at National University for **CYB333 â€“ Security Automation**.

## ðŸ”§ Project Components

### 1. `port_scanner.py`
A custom-built Python port scanner that:
- Scans ports 1â€“1024 on a given host
- Uses TCP sockets (`socket` module)
- Handles errors gracefully (e.g., timeouts, invalid input)
- Logs open ports to a file (`scan_results.txt`)
- Includes runtime and detailed comments

### 2. Socket Client & Server
Two Python scripts simulating basic network communication:
- **`socket_server.py`** â€“ Listens on a port, receives a message, and responds
- **`socket_client.py`** â€“ Connects to the server, sends a message, and prints the reply
- Demonstrates understanding of socket handling, communication flow, and error catching

### 3. `reflection.docx`
A written reflection discussing:
- The development process
- Testing strategy
- Ethical considerations
- Use of AI (ChatGPT) for support and guidance
- Learning outcomes from implementing real-world security tools

### 4. `scan_results.txt`
Example output file generated by the port scanner.

## ðŸ“œ AI Assistance Log

ChatGPT supported this project for:
- Drafting initial socket code structure
- Debugging port scanner logic
- Clarifying error types
- Reviewing final code formatting and best practices

All code was reviewed and modified to meet assignment goals, with a complete understanding of implementation decisions.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Practical understanding of socket programming in Python
- Ethical use of scanning tools with safe targets (`localhost`, `scanme.nmap.org`)
- Gained confidence in writing, testing, and documenting cybersecurity tools
- Learned how to integrate AI into the development process responsibly
